--> ABSTRACT
  1- Abstract Methods must be overridden.
  2- Abstarct methods can not be static as static methods can not be overridden.
  3- Abstarct methods can not be final as final methods can not be overridden.
  4- Abstarct Methods can only be defined in Abstract class.
  5- we can overide abstract method as anonoymous functions also
  
  6- Abstarct class can have all kinds of variable i.ie final,static etc.
  7- Abstract class can have normal static,final,default and all kind of methods
  8- Abstract class can not be instatiated but can be inherited.
  9- Abstract class can have constructor
  10- Abstract class can also be access if we create a anonymous function if we do not want to extend it to class
  

--> INTERFACES
  1- All the varibles in interface are by default final and static.
  2- interface can have default and static methods with their definition
  3- No Methods can be final in interface.
  4- Interface methods can also be defined with anonymous function concept , if we do not want to implement it to class.
  5- All methods in interface except default and static are by default abstract.
  
--> DIFFERENCE OF ABSTRACT AND INTEFACE
1) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	Interface supports multiple inheritance.
2) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.	Interface has only static and final variables.
3) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
 
 
 STATIC AND FINAL
 ----------------
 1- Staic means the memory for that variable and method is created only once in enitre program and that the field can  be accessed 
 with classname and directly if accessed in same class in which it is declared and with object also.
 2- Final makes the field imuttable i.e non changeable, non-inheritable.
 3- A class can not be static unless it is Innner class or Nested class
 4- Static Methods can be final but not abstract.
 5- In static methods we can use static variables only.
 
--> Final
  1- It makes a class Imuutable
  2- Final Methods and class can not be Overridden and Inherited respectively
  3- Final Methods and Variable can be static
  4- It can not have setters 
  5- Maps can not be Imumutable
  6- Make Deep copy of  objects
  
---> Consumer is functional Interface which accept one arguement and gives result. It hs 2 functions: .accept(), .andThen()
---> Supplier is functional Interface which does not accept any arguement and gives result. It hs 1 functions: .get()
---> Reducer,Stream,Filter,Predicate,Supplier EXAMPLE:
List<Integer> integers= Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
        Predicate<Integer> evenFilter=e->e%2==0;
        Supplier<Integer> x=()->integers.stream().filter(evenFilter).reduce(0,(a1, a2) ->a1+a2);
        System.out.println(x.get());
    

--> . In Java, all non-static methods are by default "virtual functions." Only methods marked with the keyword final, which cannot be overridden, along with private methods, which are not inherited, are non-virtual
  
--> contructor autowiring is preferred over @Autowire annotation to maintain robustness

--> for stroring password char[] is used in place of string because we can perform sanity on char [] but string is imuutable so if change the content of string then also pass word remains some where in memory
 
--> JVM ,JDK,JRE
  JDK - Are tools for for develoment
  JRE- Eneviroment for running java applications
  JVM - Interprets the code  and run un jre

--> == check the object memory pointed but .equals() checks if the value of 2 objects are equal or not

--> stack memory stores the variables and method execution where as heap memory is ued in du=ynamic memory allocation like if there is memory needed in between eexecution.

--> method overloading is compile time polymorphism and method overiding is copile time polymorphism

--> check exception: check in comile time like file not found in file handeling
    unchecked exception: checked during runtime like divinf number by zero


--> synchronization in java
    1- Mutual exclusive
       1- Method(Synchronized method)
       2- Block(like in redemption flow )
       3- static synchronization like as i did in printing odd even numbers in thread wise
    2- Cooperation Thread Communication

--> Hashmap vs hash table, internal working of hashmap
   1-Hashmap accepts one null key and multiple null value and is not thread safe, where as hash table does not accepts null value or key and thread safe
   2- Final map can be changes as map points to a memory and we can add or remove more elements.
   3- concurrentHashMap are thread safe

--> String builder is more efficient and not thread safe but String buffer is less efficient and thread safe  

--> final makes variable immutable, finally is executed anyhow after try catch even after return in catch, finalize is used for garbage coolection(System.gc)

--> Handeling exception in generic way in spring boot
@ControllerAdvice
public class ExceptionHandling {
    @ExceptionHandler(CustomException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<Object> getCustomExceptionMessage(CustomException customException){
        return new ResponseEntity<>(customException.getMessage(), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}


--> Executor service
    1- Executor services use blocking queue which is thread safe.

--> @Service, @Component, @ Repository

--> @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="dashboard_client_id",nullable = false)
    private DashboardClientMasterModel dashboardClientMasterModel;
--> @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(name = "dealer_details_group_mapping", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "dealer_id"), 
    inverseJoinColumns =@JoinColumn(name = "group_id"))
    private List<DashboardClientDealerGroupModel> dashboardClientDealerGroupModels;

 --> InnoDB has row-level locking. MyISAM only has full table-level locking

--> @Controller annotation indicates that the class is a “controller” like a web controller.
    @RestController annotation indicates that class is a controller where
    @RequestMapping methods assume @ResponseBody semantics by default.
    In @Controller, we need to use @ResponseBody on every handler method
    
   
 --> In function overiding we can not overide public function from superclass  to private function in subclass
 

-->  public Predicate toPredicate(Root<PromocodeMasterModel> root, CriteriaQuery<?> query, CriteriaBuilder cb) {
                if(fromDate==null && toDate==null){
                    return cb.isTrue(cb.literal(true)); // always true = no filtering
                }
                query.orderBy(cb.asc(root.get("updateTimestamp")));
                if(fromDate==null && toDate!=null){
                    return cb.lessThanOrEqualTo(root.get("useDateTime"),toDate);
                }
                if(fromDate!=null && toDate==null){
                    return cb.greaterThanOrEqualTo(root.get("useDateTime"),fromDate);
                }
                if(fromDate!=null && toDate!=null && fromDate.before(toDate)){
                    return cb.between(root.get("useDateTime"),fromDate,toDate);
                }
                return cb.isTrue(cb.literal(true)); // always true = no filtering
}


-> Lifecycle of threads in java
-> Jpa vs Hibernate

-> serialization is used to convert object to bytesteam and deserialixation is viceversa.
  Student s1 =new Student(211,"ravi");                                                 
  FileOutputStream fout=new FileOutputStream("f.txt");    
  ObjectOutputStream out=new ObjectOutputStream(fout);    
  out.writeObject(s1);    
  out.flush();   
  
  ObjectInputStream in=new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("f.txt"));  
  Student s=(Student)in.readObject();  
  //printing the data of the serialized object  
  System.out.println(s.id+" "+s.name);  

-> @Transient is used to prevent the a filed in objet to get serialized
 
-> In function overiding return type can be different.

THREAD LIFECYCLE
------------------

        |---------1- NewBorn State ( thread has been created but not running, when we create object  of thread)
        |     |-<>2- Runable State (When we call t1.start method, but still not running , but ready to run, available in queue to get executed)
t1.stop |     |-<>3- Running state
        |         4- Blocked State (when we use sleep,wait suspend state,and  thread can be made runnable by notify and resume method
        |-------->5- Dead State(when we call t1.stop())
